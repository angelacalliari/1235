---What I gather: two Military Police officers were stuck in a traffic jam on Washington Luiz Highway, in a favela in Duque de Caxias. The MP turn their siren on to signal to the people to clear the way. Criminals caught up in the congestion of traffic opened fire, shooting passenger in the face and chest. Driver got shot in the shoulder, four people in two buses behind them were struck as well. No one died.

Surprisingly, the shooters got away, after running on foot and abandoning their car.
