--------As Haiti faces a fourth day of protests and violence as anger grows over allegations of government corruption. Schools, businesses and government offices remain closed while scattered protests are reported across the country.

“Haiti is always in crisis, but this crisis is the worst I’ve seen,” said Dieufete Lebon, a 35-year-old moto-taxi driver who was looking for clients in the largely empty streets of Port-au-Prince.

Meanwhile, it’s business as usual in the ravaged soaked land; a thief is dragged on the road attached to motorbike with feet bond, what appears to be pantyhose.
