-------The massacre in Alcaçuz prison in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, took place over two weeks ago, but random videos of violence that accompanied it still continue to surface. Here’s another one of them.

The video shows inmates attempting to behead and dismember a dead rival, but their machetes seem to be quite dull so progress is slow. At around 0:37, there is a stabbing frenzy riled up by chants, but the best part is at 0:47, when the guy trying to sever the victim’s arm finally succeeds, and walks away like – finally got me my desert.

The corpse is then dragged to the burning pile where other inmates are already turning crisp.
