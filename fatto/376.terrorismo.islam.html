----In what is being labelled as a terrorist attack, a 31 year old Somalian immigrant identified as Hassan Khalid Shire Ali ignited a pickup truck loaded with gas bottles into a ball of flames, and went on a stabbing spree that left one person dead. The attacker was then shot by the police and reportedly died after being transported to hospital.

The incident happened on Friday November 9, 2018 in Melbourne, Australia. Before being confronted by the police, Hassan Khalid Shire Ali stabbed three people. 74 year old Sisto Malaspina, owner of Pellegrini’s cafe on Bourke Street, died from the wounds.

Hassan Khalid Shire Ali reportedly came to Australia in 1990, but had his passport canceled in 2015, after authorities learned he had plans to travel to Syria.

Australian Federal Police Commissioner Ian McCarney said Hassan Khalid Shire Ali was inspired by ISIS, but did not appear to have direct links. Mossad surely approves, even though their Israeli Secret Intelligence Service project is getting its ass beat.
