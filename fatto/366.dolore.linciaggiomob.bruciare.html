This looks like your typical case of lynching from Brazil, but everyone in the video looks so black, it’s probably from Africa.

At the beginning of the video, a guy is seen laying on the ground, barely catching his breath, as one of those pocket shotguns (what are those called?) and a few shells are rested on his body. His face is badly swollen from beating he had taken earlier, and next to him is a pool of blood.

He is then firebombed with a Molotov Cocktail but somehow manages to gather the last of his strength and takes off.

The video resumes with him being shown stripped naked, with apparent burns on the skin of his legs, at which point the villagers proceed to stone him with bricks. He took a few headshots that should have knocked him out cold, yet he still somehow clang to life.

Eventually, after being beaten to a point of not being able to resist anymore, he’s doused in gasoline and set on fire. At that point, he just let the flames consume him.

Props to Portuguese Dude for the video:
