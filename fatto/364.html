-----A CCTV video from a kitchen in some Asian country shows a cook calmly approaching another from behind with a meat cleaver in his hand. Without much hesitation, he starts chopping the other cook in the head, delivering one violent blow after another. You can see chunks of hear and skull fly through the air as he chops the head to bits.

The copping was so violent, after a while the cleaverâ€™s blade broke. So he grabs another cleaver, and continues with his onslaught. Meanwhile, the victim collapses to the floor, where the attacker delivers several final blows to the neck, almost causing decapitation. He then hastily vacates the kitchen.
