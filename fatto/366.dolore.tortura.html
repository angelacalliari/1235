----We all knew, after the Venezuela Prison Videos, this would happen again somewhere; this time in Brazil.

A thief was ratted out for stealing his mother’s house fan, worth about 8 dollars to a favela commando. A mother’s love for her son suggests she wouldn’t turn him in, perhaps it was an overzealous older brother? Although, we are all well aware how evil a mother’s love for her son can be.

At one point, the thief seems to enjoy his castings of plastic on skin. Threats of face burning with the molted plastic forces en-captured criminal to repeat the following: “I’m not gonna steal from her again… I am going to work and will help her.” …in a patronizing way. Too bad the thief still didn’t have that house fan – might have helped cool off those intense burns!
